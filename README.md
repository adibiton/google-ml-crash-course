Notes and examples from the google ml crash course

***Framing: Key ML Terminology***  

***Labels***  
The prediction we would like to make (e.g. y variable in simple linear regression)  

***Features***  
A feature is an input variable (x)

***Examples***  
A labeled example - includes both feature(s) and the label - used for ***train*** the network   

An unlabeled example - contains features but not the label  

***Models***  
**training** means creating or **learning** the model  
**Inference** means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples  

****Regression vs. classification****    

Regression model predicts continues values answering questions like:
* What is the value of a house in California?
* What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?

Classification model predicts discrete value, answering questions like:
* Is a given email message spam or not spam?
* Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
