***Framing: Key ML Terminology***
***Labels***
The prediction we would like to make (e.g. y variable in simple linear regression)

***Features***
A feature is an input variable (x)

***Examples***
A labeled example - includes both feature(s) and the label - used for ***train*** the network

***Models***

****Regression vs. classification****

Regression model predicts continues values answering questions like:
* What is the value of a house in California?
* What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?

Classification model predicts discrete value, answering questions like:
* Is a given email message spam or not spam?
* Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
